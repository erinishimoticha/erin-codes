## Tests
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/erinspice/quasix-getopt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/erinspice/quasix-getopt)

This is a pretty cheesy personal resume site thingy that I put together to aggregate my presence on the internet.

## Requirements
* Node/ES6
* Express
* SQLite

## TODO
* Use more Angular stuff. Convert portfolio to directives.
* Write tests.
* Write API routes to update resume facts instead of JSON.
* Document routes with RAML.
* Provide RAML console for testing API.
* Serve API in DSON as well as JSON, just for fun.
